<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2022_ENTRY_400</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In a past <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_383/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a> which I wrote within the past week, I mentioned that I identify as being 70% KARL and 30% KARLINA (with the intended implication that KARL represents a masculine personality (and character whom I play the role of) while KARLINA represents a feminine personality (and character whom I play the role of)). In all honesty, I prefer to replace KARLINA with KARBYTES (and KARBYTES represents a genderless personality and rather impersonal and transpeciest character whom I do more than play the role of. KARBYTES seems to be the &#8220;kernel&#8221; of my soul; the essence of my sense of self).</p>
<p>Related to this is the idea I have which is that femininity is a disability and an adaptation humans acquired through rape-mongering and violence-mongering politics which makes a commodity and virtue out of advertising one&#8217;s fragility, docility, weakness, small mindedness, and dependence on someone &#8220;more competent&#8221; to make up for &#8220;her&#8221; genetically and culturally acquired inefficiencies and underdeveloped physical and mental fitness. As radical of a notion as this may sound, I would like to promote the idea that, as human civilization becomes more advances and humans perfect the means to alter their bodies using technology and to outsource sexual reproduction of new humans to machines, a human advertising its fertility and complementary feminine phenotypal attributes will no longer be necessary to keeping the human species from going extinct. (I believe that such technology is already capable of being produced and utilized now and the reason it is not (at least according to the general public) is because forcing female bodied humans to euphanize being handicapped solely to sell their &#8220;worth&#8221; to human civilization as a means to help a man produce heirs and as a trophy for a man to acquire and derive intense, exciting, and intoxicating pleasure from acquiring in a competitive status-oriented game of sexual conquest (and such a setup is &#8220;the tried and true way&#8221; to keep women from seriously getting to the root of what is wrong with their behavior and expectations and why they never seem to close the gap of some loop before having kids and being forced to die before closing that gap while passing the tradition of not closing the gap before passing that tradition on as a family heirloom)).</p>
<p>What gap am I talking about? The gap between where a woman wants to be and where she is seems to be a chasm whose length is definitely greater than zero. She seems to never have enough time to seriously pursue personal development goals and cultivating a rigorous and worldly intellect because, as soon as she enters puberty, she is treated like a hot commodity to be auctioned off (by whoever her legal guardians are) to the highest bidder as quickly as possible such that she is locked into a game of romantic courtship and necessarily drama filled interpersonal relationship dynamics which distract her from being able to spend her precious time and energy on seriously pursuing personal development goals and cultivating a rigorous and worldly intellect (because such self-enhancement threatens the man&#8217;s position as the smarter and more politically powerful party in that relationship dynamic). The fatal blow to such self enhancement is pregnancy without the means to terminate the pregnancy and without the means to use effective contraception or even to abstain from sexual intercourse. In all instances of women falling pregnant I have seen in writing, the women seem to act as if they always have to worry about becoming pregnant (with the unspoken implication that she is worn down into giving into an aggressive and coercive man&#8217;s advances within a patriarchal culture which normalizes such covert bullying and covert slow-motion rape). The best solution I can think of to not being handicapped by socially enforced femininity is to stay single, stay celibate, and even go so far as to take testosterone injections to acquire some of the phenotypal and functional characteristics which only male bodied humans historically have had the means to manifest in themselves.</p>
<p>It has been suggested to me by anti-transgender people that someone &#8220;groomed&#8221; me to think that I need to disguise myself as a man in order to live a good life. I would like to say that I am taking the testosterone injections, working out, studying the subject that matter to me, doing the most I can to uphold what I think are my basic human rights and to not sacrifice them in order to conform to what I think is a (largely) dysfunctional society, and using whatever gender pronouns and names which suit my preference because I enjoy being on the masculine side of androgynous rather than on the feminine side of androgynous (which means that I would rather be &#8220;mistaken&#8221; for a man than for a woman even though I am essentially genderless).</p>
<p>Mostly women have stood up to me (but not by being very direct with their intentions and while acting antagonistic, butt-hurt, and passive aggressive as though they are too crippled by fear and environmentally-induced weakness of mind and body to approach me in a more clever, attractive, and solutions-oriented manner) by stalking me in public, standing by and glaring at me, and saying cryptic and ad hominem things to me next to me (but in a manner which looks like them talking to someone else (usually a kid or a dog)). I get the sense that those women feel threatened by the way I think that society has groomed most women to be physically (but especially mentally) weak in order to coax them into staying in their lowly arcane roles as sex slave, birthing cow, and status object of a pet. I found an article today that went so far as to suggest that men are not as smart about cybersecurity as women are even though that article cites that men are more likely than women to use technological means to protect their identities online and that, even though women spend more time on social media than men, the women strive for a smaller audience and tend to be less satisfied with their social media experience (because men tend to promote sharing ideas intended for a global audience instead of just for a close-knit group of sniveling simpletons who are too deprived of free time and future planning opportunities to expand their minds to get into interests which are not about menial chores and basic upkeep of the household).</p>
<p>I am not interested in congratulating women for doing little more than trading in their freedom to be single, manly, and a lot more self indulgent so that they can use the significant others in their life as the excuse for why those women are unable to do much more than settle for being a basic bitch and bitching about it with other basic bitches. If women are an endangered species, then so be it! I would love to see an end to femininity and an uprising of gender-nonconforming people who see femininity for what it is: a costume which might be fun to wear at times but not fun to be forced to wear at all times (and quite crippling to wear in circumstances which do not make sex and partying the epicenter of existence).</p>

<p>Passage_From_Referenced_Article:</p>
<p><em>&#8216;&#8230;Women tend to spend more time on the internet and use social media for personal reasons more than men. Women are also warier of what they post online and are less likely to equate their social media presence with personal popularity or success. How are these differences reflected in the ways men and women seek to protect their online privacy and security?</em></p>
<p><em>Men (66%) were slightly more likely than women (61%) to report having had security problems such as having an account compromised or hacked, or accidentally installing spyware, malware or a virus. Even so, women felt markedly less confident (52%) than men (33%) that they were protected from a range of security problems such as phishing, pharming, or having their bank, computer, or online accounts hacked. While women felt less secure, they were only marginally more likely (68%) than men (65%) to say they would like access to additional layers of online protection.</em></p>
<p><em>An interesting difference between the ways men and women act to protect themselves online emerged in the HMA survey. Women tend to rely more on personal means of protection than men. For example, it was noted earlier that women are more careful than men about the personal information they share online. Women (62%) were also more likely than men (49%) to make use of personalized privacy settings. After they experienced a security problem, women (61%) were more likely than men (51%) to make lasting changes in their online behavior in order to protect themselves from future problems.</em></p>
<p><em>Men, on the other hand, tend to rely marginally but consistently more on technical means of protection. Men tend to make greater use of VPNs (13% vs. 8% for women), email encryption programs (10% vs. 7%), IP masking sites (10% vs. 5%), password managers (20% vs. 17%), privacy enhancing browser plug-ins (18% vs. 13%) and two-factor authentication (15% vs. 12%).</em></p>
<p><em>It may be that men are more confident than women that they are protected online because they tend to rely more heavily on technical means of protection. It may also be that men are more likely to be clueless when it comes to online security&#8230;&#8217;</em></p>
<p>(That last sentence seems unlikely given the sentence immediately before it. How does having a better technical understanding of a system than my competitor make me more clueless about that system than my competitor? (That&#8217;s a rhetorical question. The answer would be: it does not) It goes to show that the women are supposed to need to be lied to more and to be told that they have special mystical abilities which science has not been able to prove exist yet. Few people will be blunt as I am and admit that women have been set back in terms of intellectual revolution and women are just not as competent at historically &#8220;male dominant&#8221; fields of expertise for that reason (because the women have been lied to and told to play with their dolls and talk about their feelings and how other people feel and how people are supposed to talk and move so as to not hurt feelings while the men get into the real substance which makes life worth living and feelings rather fleeting, trivial, and a waste of time to dwell on). There is no need to tell the ignorant that ignorance is knowledge to make the ignorant feel better. If that makes a woman feel better, she is not exactly mentally healthy in my opinion and neither is she rational enough to be proficient in rigorous disciplines where mathematical and logical reasoning are essential). It should be noted that I am not interested in counseling mentally ill people. I would rather restrict my interpersonal interactions to being with people who share my interests and values and with people who are autonomous enough to manage their own selves without needing to cling onto someone else in order to have a self.</p>
<p>If you are mad at me for how I treat women (like human beings who have either settled for being rendered subhuman slaves to the patriarchy or else relatively liberated beings who have been fortunate enough to escape such spiritual impoverishment), you are suggesting that I should praise women for giving into the patriarchy because that is probably what you condone (because women who are as powerful and free as men dissolves the patriarchy (and if you want the patriarch to stay in tact so that one gender can subjugate the other, my words may come across as threatening to your notion of what a utopia is)). I am not saying that human civilization should be more feminine-centric. I think it should continue to value masculinity over femininity for the reasons I attempted to describe in this blog post.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to suggest that women are expected to focus on people instead of on physical things which are not people (and people (A) who focus on other people (B) must be focusing on people (B) who are focused on impersonal physical things in order A to have meaning in life (because the meaning which A experiences comes indirectly from B&#8217;s relatively direct interest in the &#8220;real world&#8221; (and A lacks an interest in the &#8220;real world&#8221; unless A has an intermediary to be a filter so that A can stay on the &#8220;humanities&#8221; side while B specializes in being proficient on the &#8220;sciences&#8221; side))). Women who go directly for the sciences and derive intrinsic pleasure from doing so and while not making a big stink about their personal identity while doing so (such that they effectively can be mistaken for a happy, smart white man) deserve better than to be called women. They deserve to be called scientists, engineers, researchers, et cetera (i.e. professions which are not about hospitality, hand holding, and staying behind with the kids and invalids). I do not see much value in being called a woman. It is the same thing as being called a retarded clown who was bred and raised to humiliate itself for other people&#8217;s fetishist amusement (as a distraction from helping humanity transcend the &#8220;need&#8221; to breed instead of to extend personal development instead of aborting it in order to have kids so that one can &#8220;shamelessly&#8221; pollute the environment, make excuses for being too time starved and money starved to be excellent at anything other than supporting a family, and miss the chance to discover how immortality may be possible and how other &#8220;dimensions&#8221; of existence can be &#8220;visited&#8221; without having to die first).</p>
