<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I attempted to sign up for &#8220;Twitter Blue&#8221; today but saw that that feature is only currently available to people with iPhones. I suppose that people with iPhones would have to pay for an entire year&#8217;s subscription to Twitter Blue and not on a monthly basis because those who have iPhones are assumed to have hundreds more dollars worth of &#8220;disposable income&#8221; per year than those who do not have iPhones. I only have an iPhone, a Kubuntu laptop, and a Windows 10 laptop as personal computing devices.</span></p>

<p>I got the idea (which I do not consider to be a very high priority for me at this time) to gather enough sand bags to build myself a small fortress which will not easily blow down in the wind and which will provide me a degree more privacy and shelter from the elements. In all honesty, anything more than I currently have seems excessive. I do not want to have to hoard and lug around a bunch more equipment than I need. I am basically living on a picnic blanket and out of a backpack. During rain I hang out in underground parking garages and other indoor spaces. I decided to leave the tent at home because tents tend to leak when it rains and they are very flimsy and billow in the wind. </p>

<p>I noticed that I have not seen any wild turkeys in the area I have been camping at since yesterday (I was about to write a diatribe about how I thought humans were deliberately abducting and/or slaughtering those turkeys because I referred to them as my friends in a Twitter reply whose screenshot I included in <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_387/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes Journal 2022 Entry # 387</a>, but I heard a turkey making rhythmic squeaks from behind the nearest oak tree and I walked over to the edge of the plateau to see one turkey still standing. I will assume (for now) that humans are not deliberately interfering with those turkeys&#8217; lives). </p>
<p>Besides turkeys, large flocks of loud honking geese often fly past the plateau I am at and land on the sprawling grass lawns. There are also crows, red tail hawks, sparrows, vultures, and, at night, owls. At a slightly lower elevation within a 100 meters of where I am sitting are places where wild rabbits and ground squirrels gather. I heard coyotes howling a few nights ago but have not seen any yet. I have heard and seen gray foxes in this area (i.e. Dublin/Pleasanton, California).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Three male turkeys walked up to the plateau and are the most vocal <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turkeys</a> I have every observed. One of them keeps making a demanding sound (as if to say, &#8220;Hey! Look at me? Wanna dance?&#8221;) while trying to make one of those turkeys in particular challenge it to some kind of dominance battle. The other turkey occasionally responded short two-syllable vocalizations (as if to say, &#8220;Yes. I am dancing.&#8221;). The turkey who keeps pushing for a fight keeps walking around the turkey it seems to want to fight with. There is no dramatic fighting. It&#8217;s all rather slow and nonviolent.</p>
<p>I hear people on the other side of the hill talking about me as though I were just an animal in a zoo for them to corral and to subject to whatever experiments they want. <span style="background:#00ff00;">(I prefer to assume that most people around me know that they are being surveilled and controlled by <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind reading and mind control technologies</a> but pretend (at least to my face) not to know that is the case in order to avoid being singled out to be tortured).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Now there are four turkeys present at the scene and each of those turkeys is preening itself silently.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Now the two turkeys which were &#8220;fighting&#8221; earlier are back to that routine. One turkey keeps making demanding sounds while the other occasionally responds vocally.</p>
