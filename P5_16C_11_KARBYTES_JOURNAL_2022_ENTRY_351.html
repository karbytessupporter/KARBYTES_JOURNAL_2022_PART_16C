<p>When I went to the UPS store in Castro Valley today in an attempt to rent the smallest post office box available, the store staff said that I had to pay for the first three months of renting that post office box (and the price of renting the smallest post office box was approximately $110). I only had $40 to spend on a post office box (and I assumed that I would be able to rent one for a month). The staff member kindly suggested that I try the federal post office about half a mile away. I went there and was told that, in addition to my photo ID, I needed to present (a) &#8220;Current lease, mortgage, of deed of trust&#8221;, (b) &#8220;Voter or vehicle registration card&#8221;, or (c) &#8220;Home insurance or vehicle policy&#8221;. I had none of those things (but the UPS store staff member said that it was sufficient to present my photo ID and a printout of my bank statement).</p>
<p>I arrived back at the &#8220;Turkey Tree&#8221; in Dublin and carried four rather heavy slabs of concrete from the quarry near the &#8220;end of the line&#8221; Dublin BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) station to the camp site in order to weigh the tent down so that it does not blow over in the wind. I am in my tent now. The courthouse I have to go to tomorrow is less than 100 meters to the east of my tent. I may or may not reschedule my appointment to renew my driver&#8217;s license. Getting a P.O. Box in time to have the new driver&#8217;s license sent to it might not be feasible (but I might still have a chance of being able to rent a P.O. Box and then renew my driver&#8217;s license (but because I think the Department of Motor Vehicles will take several weeks to mail me my new driver&#8217;s license, my current plan is to simply attend the appointment I have scheduled at the Pleasanton DMV on Monday. Hopefully my driver&#8217;s license will not get intercepted by someone who wants to withhold my mail)).</p>
