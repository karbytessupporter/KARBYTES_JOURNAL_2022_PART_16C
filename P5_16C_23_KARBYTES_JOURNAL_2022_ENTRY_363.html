<p>If humans discovered a way to extend the lifespan of a human being indefinitely, I would not want such a discovery to be hidden from the public nor patented and made accessible to only some humans. I would want every human being to have the opportunity to decide for itself whether or not it wants to keep on living or else die (and no one would be forced to die either by overt or else by covert means to hasten that person&#8217;s death). I would not want humans having more babies until I was sure that humans were on their way to successfully inhabiting regions beyond Planet Earth and, even more urgently, on their way to permanently reversing ecological damage.</p>
<p><strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000;">As gruesome as this may sound, I cannot help but think that every human who decides to give birth to a child in this day and age given how prevalent overpopulation is and how badly Earth&#8217;s ecosytems and climate are being destabilized and rendered uninhabitable for humans to live inside of is implicitly demanding that some other human die to make way for baby! ðŸ˜¡</strong></p>
