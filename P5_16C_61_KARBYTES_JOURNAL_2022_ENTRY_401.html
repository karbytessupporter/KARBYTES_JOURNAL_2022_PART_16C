<p>I suspect that the tyrants who bombard me with messages which I think are transmitted via electromagnetic waves and who apparently decipher what my brain activity is about enough to generate a simulation of what my first-person subjective experience is like want me to conclude that <span style="background:#ffff00;">getting some kind of entry level job which requires little more than a high school diploma is the master key to unlock everything in my life which I currently seem to lack access to</span> such as the ability to travel the world, rent hotel rooms, replace and upgrade electronics and survival gear, rent movies to watch, et cetera (and that as long as I depend on my parents for money, I will not be allowed by the tyrants who lord over me using <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind-reading and mind-control technology</a> to receive PayPal donations from people other than my parents because <span style="background:#ffff00;">the tyrants have absolute nonnegotiable power to override my computer usage</span>).</p>
<p>The year 2023 is when I (tentatively) plan to, at the latest, go into &#8220;stealth mode&#8221; after going through at least a week of going &#8220;off the grid&#8221; (i.e. abstain from making social media posts and from adding new web pages from my website and from making any edits to existing website content). &#8220;Stealth mode&#8221; is my planned ego death phase (and I intend to buy some magic mushrooms with the intention of doing at least one &#8220;heroic dose&#8221; after my web content is finalized in preparation for the new year). <span style="background:#00ffff;">If I have profound enough insights to write about, I will document them but be more careful about how I accumulate digital property so that I do not continue the trend of outputting as high of a volume and as low in salience density as I have been thus far.</span></p>
<p>After my &#8220;stealth mode&#8221; activities are complete, I will be especially ready to sell myself as a slave to whatever menial job I end up applying for. That I believe will allow the story of my life to progress to the next chapter; a chapter which I hope and expect to be at least as grand and worth writing about as the phase in which I currently reside.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">(After I publish this web page, I will probably add no more than five pages to the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes Journal 2022</a> section of this website before I close that section and mark it as finalized).</span></p>
