<p><em>A screaming, crying, red-faced, bloated baby</em></p>
<p><em>is what a woman is</em></p>
<p><em>while a man is a smirking, loitering punk who stands over her wherever she lies down</em></p>
<p><em>to make sure that she stays down so that he is always the stronger party.</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><em>He&#8217;s an old man who looks like a farmer and he&#8217;s holding torture equipment.</em></p>
<p><em>The woman lying at his feet looks like a mutilated, terrified, paralyzed, ritualistically tortured sow.</em></p>
<p><em>She whines, whimpers, and wails pleading for the nightmare to be over.</em></p>
<p><em>He mocks her making soft, lewd, taunting noises while he holds her nervous system hostage decreases the likelihood that she will recover the faculties he severed by cutting her off from the right to use her nervous system.</em></p>
<p><em>He is a sadistic, power-hungry cop acting as an authoritarian father.</em></p>
<p><em>She is the mutilated little girl who is putty in his hands being treated as a criminal in need of punishment for not conforming to his every whim at all times.</em></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><em>The woman whimper &#8220;consoling&#8221; messages to each other to relinquish bodily and mental autonomy so that they are spared the most torture possible hy the patriarchs which hold their civilization hostage.</em></p>
<p><em>Without a car, you simply cannot hold down a job. End of story.</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Returning the car that I have been borrowing to my mother is what I intend to do as soon as I publish and back up this note. I will do my best to avoid borrowing it again in favor of walking, bicycling, and using public transportation. Also, the air inside my legal residence is more laden with cigarette smoke than usual (and I see that no mail is in my mail box (which makes me suspicious that my parents are intercepting my mail and other possessions in an effort to control and gaslight me into submission with the authorities they side with out of cowardice and stubborn addiction to keeping me in chronic &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; mode for their sadistic amusement and convenience)).&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;I have to &#8220;extremes&#8221; to do what I consider to be the bare minimum in terms of self care because other people are jeoulus of me and try to obstruct me.&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</em></p>

<p>To change the subject to some relatively light hearted humor and amusement, here a cartoon I recently found while browsing my Instagram feed. The image below the cartoon depicts what I think AJP looks like, what SED looks like, my brother looks like, what I look like, and what some other young &#8220;psychopathic&#8221; millenial-aged males look like on the inside (especially those hollowed eyes which have seen many horrors and which are now staring out of the face of a demented clown pretending to be a white collar professional from a cede background).&nbsp; (</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">(I honestly think that face looks hot (i.e. attractive in a way which activates my deviant and lewd &#8220;soul fragments&#8221;)). This is me breaking the spell of being in a hypnotic trance of long term role play game in which I act like a high-strung, quaint feminazi. (I give myself fucking permission to drive any car if I think doing so is the only means to accomplish some goal I think is too important to miss out on accomplishing).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I apologize if this journal seems a bit &#8220;odd&#8221;. I am a wee bit high on shrooms (and I am glad for it).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I am afraid that my parents are innocent and that the police are trying to turn me against them (and against myself).</p>
<p>I am afraid that the police are trying to prevent me from being able to live without a car so that my leg muscles and cardiovascular fitness atrophy so that I am not as physically able to live outdoors and to walk as my primary commute.</p>
<p>My father is a bone thin sedentary fat fetishist man who likes to drive past me when I am walking in order to make me feel suffocated. He also fills &#8220;my&#8221; house with his poisonous clouds of smoke for the same reason and likes to just sit there in his house waiting for me to freak out while he smirks and watches.</p>
<p>I suspect that my mother is complicit in this and is obsessed with keeping me trapped in her incestuous rape porn (and that she is hostile to me having a sense of humor and a genuine appetite for pursuing worldly interests (so that I spend all my time and energy fighting to break free of the imprisonment and torture she wants me mired in for years)).</p>
<p>When I called my mom on the phone today and asked her for the Friday $100 early, she said yes then immediately asked me in an irritated tone, &#8220;How did your job interview go,&#8221; like she didn&#8217;t want anything in my life to go well. I told her that I didn&#8217;t go to my interview yet. Then she asked me if I went to my DMV appointment to get my driver&#8217;s license. I said yes. Then she said, &#8220;Are your sure?&#8221; to insinuate that (a) she did not beleive me and (b) that she was stalking me online (and possibly offline) in order to make me feel deprived of privacy from her intrusive surveillance and tyrannical attempts to control me. She asked if I got the driver&#8217;s license at the DMV or if if was being mailed to my dad&#8217;s house (seemingly because she is opposed to me having my own Post Office Box because, if I did, that would mean I would not have to worry about people acting as my mother&#8217;s minions to bully me and to confiscate my mail). I told her that my new license would be arriving in the mail. I said nothing of my plans to rent a P.O. Box as soon as I can afford one (and I changed both of the dates of my upcoming DMV and UPS store appointments to ensure that I would have enough money to first rent a mailbox at the UPS store for three months before going into the DMV to renew my driver&#8217;s license so that I can have it mailed to that mailbox instead of my dad&#8217;s address).</p>
<p>I understand that this journal is a bit garbled. There are lots of noises in my head and the high from the shroom has been steadily getting stronger as I have written this blog post. (Damn a little of that penis envy shroom goes a long way (and I got quite a hefty amount for $60 at Zide Door in Oakland)). I am currently in the backyard at my dad&#8217;s house (at approximately 9PM using my phone to establish an Internet connection because the house Wi-Fi is unreliable for me no matter how close to the router I am).</p>
<p>I think that this <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a> may be relevant to the last journal entry I made while a bit high on shrooms.</p>
