<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I feel that the time has come for me to slow down the rate at which I add new pages to this website. For now on, I will try to add no more than one page per week. Perhaps that will give me target audience (whether real or imagined) time to &#8220;catch up&#8221; and process what I have already written. Also, it will signify to the general public that I am getting ready to work full time (which means that I would not have time to add more than one new page to this website per week). At the very least, limiting the rate at which I add new pages to this website to no more than once per week helps to make it look like I do not have any more free time than anyone else has in my society.</p>
<p>If you are still reading this letter, then you got to the part where I say that the previous paragraph was just a test and that I do not intend to impose any limit on how often I add new pages to this website.</p>

<p>I wrote this page while feeling &#8220;homesick&#8221; for a place where I can be alone and not subject to the bullying voices which are transmitted to my skull wirelessly from law enforcement. I think they want me to feel deprived of &#8220;narcissistic supply&#8221; and forced to spend most of my time doing nothing other than listening to them as part of a covert agenda to make me appear to be homeless and cut off from having any outlets other than computer science.</p>
