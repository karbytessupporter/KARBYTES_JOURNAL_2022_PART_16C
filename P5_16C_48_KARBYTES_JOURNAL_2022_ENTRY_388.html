<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Later Edit: I removed all the social media posts from my Minds and Twitter profiles which link to a web page in this website (i.e. the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) after the post in which I share a link to <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_339/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes 2022 Journal Entry # 339</a> (and that post is currently pinned to the top of both social media profiles until 31_DECEMBER_2022 (and I will re-share that same social media post such that it is at the top of the list of each one of those two social media posts (and beneath any pinned post which may be present))). There is a link to Karbytes 2022 Journal Entry # 339 which is currently pinned to the top of my Facebook profile (and I will unpin that Facebook post no later than 31_DECEMBER_2022).<br /></span></p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I decided to not add any more posts to my Instagram account (@karbytes_anew) for at least the remainder of this year (i.e. the year which is labeled 2022). The final Instagram <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_382/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> on my Instagram profile is a square image containing a diagram which was copied from the web page whose Universal Resource Locator (i.e. web page address) is displayed as plaint-text in the description of that Instagram post (and that referenced web page is named <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POINT</a> and a component of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. (My goal is also to &#8220;tie up loose ends&#8221; with other social media threads in addition to my Instagram post output stream by eliminating what I think are insufficiently useful trains of thought (which manifest as thematic threads pertaining to social media posts which are listed (and published) in chronological order with exactly two endpoint posts).</span></p>
