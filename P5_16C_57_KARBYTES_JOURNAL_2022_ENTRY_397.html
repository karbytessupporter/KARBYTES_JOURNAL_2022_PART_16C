<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">&#8220;Although an analog recording of a song (using a medium such as a magnetic tape or else a vinyl record) might contain more data which represents that song, a digital recording of the same song is verbatim transmissible between mediums and relatively lossless.&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</span></p>
<p>The above quote is perhaps my favorite original short thought of the year. I would also like to mention that, as a lifelong (mostly self-taught) student, my goal is to earn the equivalent of an English degree (already have it), a Computer Science degree (almost have it), and a Physics degree (starting at a relatively science-oriented layperson level) and <span style="background:#00ffff;">to use that expertise to develop and to refine as perfectly logical, concise, and aesthetically pleasing of a personal website cluster as possible (with <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> being the crown jewel of that website cluster).</span></p>
<p>* Note that the tweet in which the quote which the <span style="background:#ffff00;">(yellow)</span> highlighted paragraph above was copied from had a misspelled word: transmissible. The copied quote has been modified to exude the correct spelling of the words it contains.</p>

<p>I expect the contents of the book which is linked in the paragraph below will be relevant for at least the next 50 years.</p>

<p>The video which is linked in the paragraph below features the author of this website playing the drums in a manner which made the pattern of percussion seem filled with a ghostly melody with &#8220;colors&#8221; in it. I get the sense that what I created is a digital psychedelic. It makes listeners &#8220;hallucinate&#8221; instruments other than the sound of drums to fill a void. <span style="background:#00ff00;">The significance of sharing this digital recording is the fact that the digital recording represents a particular space-time continuum in which phenomena change in relation to a fixed time continuum in which time progresses forward at a constant rate of frames per second (and each frame contains a finite amount of digital information depicting a finite &#8220;point&#8221; along a space-time continuum). I like how videos are basically <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clocks</a>.</span></p>
