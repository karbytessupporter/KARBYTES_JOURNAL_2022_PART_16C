<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following GitHub and Internet Archive links lead to some files which I uploaded today after copying those files from optical discs which I had stowed away in my room.</span></p>
<p>I was not able to make zip file uploads and downloads (and uploading each file one at a time to GitHub was very slow) while using my laptop at my dad&#8217;s house (using the Wi-Fi and my Anroid phone mobile data). I was able to upload one file at a time to GitHub slightly faster after walking up the hill about 50 meters from my house but saw that the zip file upload and download was very slow.</p>
<p>I noticed angry fat women standing on the side of the road on my way to my house. I think that Steve might have been hired by my dad to make sure that I cannot have a career in my dad&#8217;s house. I also noticed that my dad took the cymbals off the drum set and that his car was gone and that some other person&#8217;s car was parked in the driveway (and I think that is because today they are having band practice and/or trying to psychologically torture me by making me feel deprived of creative outlets).</p>
<p>I think that civilians and cops disapprove of me being so &#8220;self indulgent&#8221; and think that I need to put in a cage and deprived of happiness and free time because I apparently had &#8220;too much&#8221; of those things (and other people&#8217;s happiness depend on me being deprived of happiness). I think that people resent me for preferring to be alone instead of being more of a socialite and social conformist. Me minding my own business is apparently very offensive to others because it makes it look like those other people are not essential to my happiness (neither as companions nor as gatekeepers). <span style="background:#ffff00;">I am nevertheless trying to avoid dealing with other people as much as possible because they mostly get in my way, slow me down, and sabotage my enjoyment of life.</span></p>
<p>(Other people are gathering me where I try to work to tell me to stop and go away. Meanwhile, people on the side walk (usually a woman, a man, and a dog) smirk and watch the show about &#8220;the war on Karlina&#8221;. I have been fighting to upload the same zip file multiple times from the area near my dad&#8217;s house. I literally might have to go to Dublin and use the Whole Food Wi-Fi because I am being censored up here so that I do not have a high standard of living and so that my time and energy is wasted for other people&#8217;s sadistic amusement and desire for retribution against me for what they perceive as &#8220;bad&#8221; behavior).</p>
<p>As I walked back to my house, a big red SUV with Hispanic guys followed me and turned around as if to make me feel oppressed, cornered, and intruded upon. That was after me saying while walking away that, if I could, I would commit genocide against their entire race because those people seem to be slowing me down the most and causing me the most unnecessary suffering out of any group of people. Then again, I could be wrong. It just seems like they are the most likely type of people to harass me in public and to act antagonistic towards me.</p>
<p>The dog next door has been barking as though it were an alarm going off because thoughts which do not support the status quo have been detected near the premises.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It is a little after 5PM. The sky looks overcast and the sun is already down. I was able to get the second GiHub repository and Internet Archive zip file upload complete by getting very close to the router in the living room. I want to nullify what I said about wanting to commit genocide. I would choose to kill myself so that many can live (because, if I do not, other people will say I deserve to be tortured and maybe murdered afterwards). I know I am a big &#8220;show off&#8221; and spend &#8220;too much time&#8221; &#8220;obsessing&#8221; over myself (according to my most ardent critics and saboteurs). <span style="background:#ffff00;">If I am remembered for one thing by the humans, it will be how deeply self absorbed I am and how much I single-mindedly labored away on art projects which may or may not be of interest to people other than myself for my own gratification (and how I tried to be unabashedly self loving and self indulgent even though doing so seems to go against the social mandate that I deprive myself of solitary pleasures so that others feel less deprived and that I allocate more of my attention span to paying attention to other people and to not being so self aware; to neglect myself more so that I am not accused of neglecting whoever I am supposed to be serving and working to earn the approval of other than myself).</span></p>
<p>Let my story serve as a warning to other people if they think they can just do whatever they want to without getting punished and obstructed by other people. There do not seem to be very many humans who are able to get away with so much self indulgence and self publishing (open source) digital media onto the Internet (with the intent of being discoverable and accessible to the general public (i.e. to any person with an Internet connection and compatible hardware and software to access the digital media I have created and uploaded to the Internet (particularly to my WordPress websites, GitHub repositories, and Internet Archive library)).</p>
<p>I am scared of other people and believe they want to see me in pain and want me to suffer. I believe that many people want me locked up in a cage and unable to pursue my artistic endeavors (and whatever else I want to do which does not require that other people micromanage how I implement those endeavors). If other people cannot control what I do, they do not seem to want me doing it.</p>
<p>I understand I sound a bit like a pouty victim and someone who has a sense of being ostracized and persecuted by other people (and that I might come across as delusional for the things I have done and said). I figure that this is a phase I need to go through in order to get to the other side of a &#8220;dark patch&#8221; in consciousness. Perhaps that is not a very accurate description of what I am attempting to implement. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Perhaps I should stop trying to explain myself so much and just do whatever it is I want to do.</span> (It is hard for me to &#8220;shut up&#8221; when others keep talking at me and harassing me. I feel compelled to keep talking out loud and explaining myself because doing so seems like appropriate self advocacy instead of just letting other people interpret what I am doing and spin it in their own narrative. <span style="background:#ffff00;">People are free to spin whatever narrative they want to about anything.</span> (Maybe they are not free to do some or even all things. Maybe free will is an illusion if not intermittent. I think that humans do have &#8220;godlike&#8221; powers to generate original artistic visions and to physically manipulate their environments to make such visions come to fruition as more than just mental phenomena confined to their own imaginations but, also as relatively physical artifacts in their environment).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I am afraid that even if I do my best to conform to society and to speak &#8220;out of turn&#8221; as little as possible I will still be bullied by other people. Therefore, I think it is best to assume that I will be bullied by people no matter what I do. (I might spend most if not the rest of my life enduring horrific psychological torture (and other forms of torture) by people who want me to suffer and to feel unwelcome in human society, undeserving of happiness, and tortured into doing things which they want me to do for their sadistic and fetishist amusement). I will assume that humans generally regard me as someone to get beaten up on their behalf and for their amusement. <strong><em>Few humans seem to be interested in doing anything other than making their wait to die as comfortable for themselves as possible. They do not seem to want to promote a universal basic income for all people, the automation of as many jobs as possible, a radical switch to ecologically sustainable infrastructure, and other futuristic ideals I support and which most others seem to dismiss as impractical and unimportant.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">I think that people hate me (or, the very least, dislike me) for appearing to be so self absorbed as a person. I am afraid that they do not want me to be happy unless I become a lot less self absorbed looking. Perhaps they want me to feel as deprived of personal space, comfort, and societal opportunities as a homeless person until and unless I rent my own place to live (and work a full time job in order to afford that change of address).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In case it is not obvious to whoever is looking at the files referenced by the GitHub and Internet Archive links on this web page, I think most of that content from over a decade ago is cringeworthy as fuck. I think I am orders of magnitude more talented and witty now (but I have not done much music recording lately because I have been too busy working on this website (and I think that is appropriate because I am able to communicate more salient information sans the cringe via the medium of HTML, CSS, and other &#8220;programming languages&#8221; (but especially using HTML and CSS)).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Some people seem to think that the following is the harshest &#8220;truth&#8221; I could admit: that even if I merely think that I am being mistreated, other people will use that as justification to mistreat me (which is an example of the old adage &#8220;Stop crying or else I will give you something to cry about&#8221;). Apparently, I am supposed to be terrorized into complaining as little as possible and to reframe what I have called mistreatment towards me by others as totally appropriate human behavior which I am &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;irrational&#8221; for construing as anything but &#8220;good&#8221;. Perhaps those who insist on such a setup want me to feel placed in an &#8220;impossible to win&#8221; situation in which I cannot help but think dissenting thoughts and feel dissenting emotions while I am punished for enabling rather than preventing myself from thinking and feeling such dissent.</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother treating Karlina as anything but an inmate and/or a crazy person who needs to be ignored, treated with callous disregard, lied to, and placed in uncomfortable circumstances in order to cure it of its narcissism. Until Karlina is reformed to what is deemed appropriate (or until/unless Karlina&#8217;s ostracization and imprisonment period ends), Karlina is to be ostracized and subject to harsher than normal treatment (because Karlina&#8217;s reputation is worse than most people&#8217;s reputation is (and Karlina has the reputation of a delinquent, repeat criminal, and conniving crook).&#8221;</p>
<p>R: &#8220;Well said, P. I will see to it that karbytes (I mean Karlina) is treated according to your suggestions.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>(Breaking the fourth wall, perhaps): I seem to be involved in a tricky battle for sanity in which I am trying to resolve &#8220;cognitive dissonance&#8221; related to me sleeping outside and feeling the need to rent a post office box and to wear a persecution complex out of self defense. I do not think I should just do what my mom seems to want (which is staying indoors at either her house or my dad&#8217;s house the vast majority of the time and to sleep indoors at those locations and to not rent a post office box). To make it harder for my situation to be construed as having my mail intercepted, <span style="background:#ffff00;">I still strongly support the idea of me renting a post office box</span> (and I have an appointment to do that within the next two weeks so that I can have my renewed driver&#8217;s license mailed there instead to the house where my dad or one of his minions might attempt to confiscate it for the sake of keeping me mired in a power struggle and feeling abused)).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I would love to move onto not feeling the need to keep reporting abuse committed against me by other people.</span> It helps to eliminate things in my life which make it easy for me to be abused by other people. Rather than focus on censoring myself to not complain about other people&#8217;s conduct towards me, I think the path of least resistance is making myself as invulnerable and predator-like as possible. Either be prey or else be a predator seems to be one of the unspoken rules about how to survive in this society. A woman is generally regarded as prey unless she has an alpha male to be her protector and keeper. I am deliberately trying to masculize my appearance so that I am treated as a man instead of as a woman. (But a man without a woman to call his subordinate is treated as a rebel in need of reformation). My life seems to be about how to live as a single and childless person who is as empowered, intellectually independent, and able to optimize its use of resources as possible. (Many people probably say I am cheating by living with my parents rent free and relying on them for 100% of my financial income). I did put a donation link on the home page of my websites such that other people should be able to send me donations so that I can receive money from people other than my parents, but almost no one has sent me donations other than my mom. Perhaps that is part of my &#8220;punishment&#8221; and or &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; to make me a better servant to society and not so self indulgent, pampered, and free to do my own thing. (I thought that getting a job would help me get more money to do my own thing, but my experiences of working over the past few years have suggested that I get a better deal just being a full time self taught student aspiring to become a software engineer while my parents support me to live relatively inexpensively). Unless my parents die, I do not think I have to worry about being forced into homelessness. Hence, I will try to stop worrying myself sick about such a thing and assume that I will not get any poorer than this for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am too lazy to be a full-time software engineer and would be better off doing a part time job which would allow me to continue to live at least as cheaply as I currently do but with the power to save more money than I spend at a rate which is not ridiculously slow (according to me). Perhaps I will do &#8220;onsite&#8221; data entry work at some office in Oakland or Berkeley. Perhaps I will do mail sorting. Perhaps I will work in a cafe. Perhaps I will have to settle for full-time employment. I think the previous sentence is true. It is probably too late for me to work part-time (but maybe it is not). <span style="background:#ffff00;">I think it is best to not worry about jobs for at least one more month so that I can focus on getting my mind &#8220;cleaned up&#8221; and organized (and my personal websites as ready for the new year as possible).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>While uploading a zip file of photographs I took with a digital camera in February of 2007 (which was before I ever owned a smartphone), I enjoyed listening to a recording I made in the lost files in which I was playing some electric guitar jam late at night and my brother stopped by my bedroom to tell me to turn the volume down and he asked if I was recording that session and I said no. That was like being a fly on the wall observing a snippet of my life many years ago. I also got up to make start a pot of coffee in the kitchen. While I was doing that, I heard someone scratching at the cat scratching post and saw Brea sharpening her claws and stretching her ligaments for climbing and for catching prey. She walked up next to me and I gave her a plate of wet cat food and a bowl of fresh water. She wanted none of those things and was sitting with her back turned towards me; waiting for me to follow her lead. She lead me to the front door where I let her out. I stepped outside to check the weather. The sky had some cirrus clouds but was mostly clear with stars visible. The air was cold but not uncomfortably so (and I am wearing three jackets, basketball shorts, and running shoes with socks (because without socks is smelly, painful, and gross).</p>
<p>I was trying to read more audio file compact discs, but the data on those discs seems to have been rendered irretrievable (and I suspect that humans did that deliberately).</p>
<p>Even though there is no cymbals, I might as well just play the drums anyway. (I remember my dad having two sets of drums and one of those sets was in the living room but he took that one out and made it seem like he wants to prevent me from getting as much drum practice in as I think I deserve because he has two sets of symbols but decided to make his drumming about me not being able to drum at the same time. I&#8217;d be playing the drums without cymbals just to feel the rhythm and not to do those cool effects I was doing on the cymbals). I guess I need to save up for my own drums if I want to be able to drum without being impeded by jealousy mongering jerks. (If you wonder why I avoid family gatherings and have stopped giving people presents on holidays and birthdays, it largely because my family of origin have been inconsiderate towards me and seemingly even deliberately cruel towards me. I rather shamelessly exploit them economically and do not enjoy their company. (I might wait until my dad comes back to ask him to restore the drum set to full functionality so that I can use it tonight (and not worry about waking up the neighbors because it&#8217;s a Saturday night and I assume no one has to go to work tomorrow within hearing range of these drums (and even if they do, oh well. I have limits in terms of how much I am willing to put my life on hold so that other people can feel comfortable)))). I remember hearing my dad say as I was walking into the garage to play drums one night, &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t sound so good after this hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last two images included in this journal entry depicts a single anniversary card (from my four-year anniversary with <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SED</a>).</p>
<p>(I just called my dad on the phone and he said he moved the drum set which used to be in the living room up to his band mates&#8217; house in Colfax because it is easier to leave it there than to keep having to take it apart and reassemble it. He said he was about five minutes away and that I could play the drums with the cymbals when he gets here with them. I told him I made some coffee. He said that sounds great. Meanwhile, Steve has been chilling in his room playing the guitar. Brea is in the garage and my dad is pulling up the driveway in his car and Brea is going out there to greet him. Well, forget all that stuff I said about people being mean to me on purpose. I hope this is all just to make things better for everyone. Let&#8217;s try to have a nice rest of the weekend, shall we? Okee dokee. I&#8217;ll do my best. Let&#8217;s just keep it cool and fun and keep putting out good vibes only (or at least fake that we are)).</p>
