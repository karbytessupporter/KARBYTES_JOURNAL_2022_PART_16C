<p>&#8220;If I am guilty of a crime which I am committing now or in the future, that crime would most likely be noninterventionism.&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">(karbytes would like to append the quote above with the following message: &#8220;If I notice another person in need of emergency assistance, I will do my best to help that person get the emergency assistance they need. For example, if I see a human laying unconscious on the ground and bloody, I will call 911 and report the incident in the hopes that an ambulance arrives and is able to safely transport that person to the hospital. If I am not in a hurry to get somewhere and happen to be on or near a BART platform and someone asks me to let them borrow my phone to make a phone call I most likely will let that person borrow my phone to make a phone call&#8221;).</span></p>

<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">&#8220;If most people spend the vast majority of their time thinking about and trying to control people who spend the vast majority of their time thinking about and trying to control people, then most people are wasting their lives in a tied game of chess.&#8221; &#8211; karbytes</span></p>
<p>(related phenomenon: <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#antmill</a>).</p>
<p>I am disappointed to see that, against my will, someone apparently logged into my Twitter account and removed the tweet which I reminded showing a short video of an ant mill. As I write this, I get constant noises from the people in my environment which sound aggressive, impatient, attention-seeking, and suppressing of my speech. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Until more humans (respectfully) convince me that they care about eliminating censorship, I have little reason to interact with humans other than to acquire economic commodities and pragmatic information. Hence, I plan to (as usual) spend the holidays alone and not amongst human &#8220;friends&#8221; and &#8220;family&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">If I run out of money, I will stealthily steal groceries from various Safeway stores in the San Francisco Bay Area. If I lack the means to replace my laptop computer if my laptops become unusable, I will resort to using public library computers and/or the school library at California State University East Bay in Hayward (using my student ID which is still currently active because I have course transcripts and financial transaction history with that institution (and I do not see why I would my student ID would be removed from the database and/or banned from being able to use the library computers to use the Internet to work on my software development and consciousness research projects).</span></p>
