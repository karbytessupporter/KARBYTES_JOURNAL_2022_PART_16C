<p>While sleeping at the church, I had some of the most vivid dreams I&#8217;ve had in a while. The first dream was me attending a summer-camp-like onboarding at the Tesla warehouse in Fremont. Many new hires (myself included) were sitting at outdoor tables assembling brochures for our personal use which would each collect weekly blood drops of our own blood. Elon Musk was leading that event and used one of my brochures as an ideal example for others to emulate. He pricked my finger such that a small drop of blood leaked out and the drop was placed inside of a circular diagram on the brochure. I saw <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SED</a> sitting at one of the tables and I tried talking to him, but he turned his back on me and I decided not to pursue the matter further. Later on the new hires were encouraged to pick out free books from the outdoor shelves and tables (and each employee apparently was recommended its own book to pick out with labels of employee names on some of those books). I was searching for the book with my name on it and some guy who reminded me of a middle aged coworker named Harold who used to work in the same department as I did when I worked for Information Technology Collaborative Services at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory suggested I pick out some interesting book about geometry which apparently also talked about philosophy. Next to it was a big illustrated book about space and the holographic principal. There was also a tiny sandbag lizard whose fabric skin looked holographic. Later on my dream switched to me laying down on a couch in some apparently abandoned house at Horsey Hill (and it had running electricity because the lights were on inside that house and it was night). Some people entered the building and when I looked up I saw <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AJP&#8217;s</a> face up close wearing a beanie and sporting some stubbly facial hair. He and the other gangsters quickly turned around and ran out of the building. I went outside to see where they went. There was a white pickup truck with its lights on. Some random white guy from that gang kindly suggested I keep using that house as a hangout even though his gang still technically used it. He recommended I use it no more than five nights a week. He actually wanted me to be one of the gangsters using the place and respected the fact that I was a gang of one and preferred to live and travel solo while using <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technological telepathy</a> to talk to bosses. The dream progressed to it being a beautiful cloud free day and me happily running down a trail on the side of the road going down the hill from Horsey Hill to the San Leandro flats. I was flipping and doing acrobatics while effortlessly (relatively) &#8220;flying&#8221; down the hill. I felt very happy. Then I woke up and saw that today is a cloud free morning in Castro Valley. I&#8217;m going to pack up my things now and head to Fremont for today&#8217;s onsite interview at Tesla.</p>

<p>I neglected to mention in this morning&#8217;s note that the part of the dream in which I was &#8220;flying&#8221; down the hill involved me deliberately taking off my backpack and leaving it on the trail behind me in order to make it easier for me to do flips with the intention of walking back up the hill to retrieve the backpack after than run.</p>
