<p>I am sitting in my tent now in Dublin but plan to leave to go back to Castro Valley as soon as I send this note to myself via <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gmail</a> to back up later. I am leaving because that female voice is torturing me more than I can stand. Multiple tracks of that voice have been playing at once. Each of those tracks is making some kind of taunting noise. The voice is sing-song, nonchalant, childlike, soft, smug, and incessant. Some tracks are soft hissing which sounds like the word &#8220;stop&#8221; being whispered repeatedly while the constant &#8220;s&#8221; is prolonged and the vowel part is barely audible (like a little girl fogging up a mirror with her breath in cold temperatures while her tiny mouth is poised to suckle a penis). <span style="background:#ffff00;">She keeps telling me to stop showing off and her words seem to imply that she wants me to curl up in a ball and cover my ears and cry and fret over feeling mentally raped and my time wasted and my plans thwarted.</span> &#8220;All you have to talk about is yourself&#8221; (and she pronounces &#8220;self&#8221; as &#8220;sewf&#8221;), &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna talk to you anymore&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay&#8221;, &#8220;Get over yourself&#8221;, and other phrases which she sometimes repeats are barraging me while a track of her humming a childish taunting melody plays. Before the rain acts up again (it&#8217;s been intermittent), I&#8217;m going to take down the tent and put the tent in its case back in my room at my dad&#8217;s house (because I think I will have a more enjoyable time using it in Castro Valley in the backwoods of Lake Chabot where I am surrounded in more natural beauty and less of that Bratz doll voiceover vibe. She is ugly, parasitic, and corrosive to my mental health).</p>

<p>The <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Bratz doll&#8221;</a> voiceover is also saying &#8220;Shut the fuck up&#8221; (even though I am not even speaking), &#8220;It&#8217;s not all about you, okay&#8221;, &#8220;You have nothing but you to talk about&#8221;, &#8220;Excuse Whore&#8221;, &#8220;Rich Bitch&#8221;, &#8220;We just didn&#8217;t want you to have such a good time alone&#8221;, and &#8220;Bye Karlina&#8221;. She makes &#8220;woo&#8221; and &#8220;yeah&#8221; sounds in victory whenever she successfully diminished my enjoyment of some momentary experience. I suppose this I will never attempt to spend the night in Dublin again. I think I am not as nonchalant and complacent as the Dublin mall rat voiceover implies I should be.</p>

<p>P: &#8220;I&#8217;m a woman. I can hit you but you can&#8217;t hit me. I&#8217;m untouchable. You&#8217;re not.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Women are unnecessary given the fact that human gametes can be derived from stem cells and lab grown human zygotes can be incubated in artificial wombs. Women have little more than tits and ass to offer. I&#8217;m a gay male and would prefer to live with masculine people only; not childish whores who deter intellectual rigor and fun outside the bedroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;It&#8217;s not okay to criticize women. You&#8217;re gonna get beaten up by my Boyfriend. He has weapons and a big mean gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;So be it.&#8221;</p>

<p>karbytes: &#8220;(Breaking the Fourth Wall): I do not actually hate women. As long as a woman has a life outside of sex, reproduction, and living vicariously through other people, I think she is likely to be as likeable to me as a man is for the same reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;To be blunt, the only people I seem to admire and to enjoy the company of are genuinely passionate science, technology, and philosophy nerds.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>P: &#8220;All you care about is you? All you care about is you, Karlina. You have nothing but yourself to talk about. Get it? Get over yourself. Shut up, lie down, and don&#8217;t move a muscle. There you go!&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;P is the epitome of what it means to be a good woman and someone the masses would adore.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;No one wants to listen to you. Get over yourself. Bye Karlina. At least I don&#8217;t have to be so sleep deprived.&#8221;</p>
