<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The video depicted in the screenshot below shows ants walking around in a circular motion as though they were skaters at a skating rink. The video is evidence of collective intelligence running into an &#8220;error&#8221; (if the &#8220;goal&#8221; of such collective intelligence is to not deplete the colony&#8217;s energy faster than the colony can replenish its energy such that the colony runs out of energy and hence dies of exhaustion).</span></p>

<p>Wikipedia: &#8216;&#8230;An ant mill is an observed phenomenon in which a group of army ants are separated from the main foraging party, lose the pheromone track and begin to follow one another, forming a continuously rotating circle, commonly known as a &#8220;death spiral&#8221; because the ants might eventually die of exhaustion. It has been reproduced in laboratories and has been produced in ant colony simulations. The phenomenon is a side effect of the self-organizing structure of ant colonies. Each ant follows the ant in front of it, which works until a slight deviation begins to occur, typically by an environmental trigger, and an ant mill forms. An ant mill was first described in 1921 by William Beebe, who observed a mill 1200 ft (~370 m) in circumference. It took each ant two and a half hours to make one revolution. Similar phenomena have been noted in processionary caterpillars and fish&#8230;&#8217;</p>
