<p>Two potential tweets I do not intend to manifest as actual tweets are the following two paragraphs:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you put a &#8216;Keep Out&#8217; sign on your door, it makes the people want to break into your room even more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even while I am awake the dream continues in the &#8216;back of my mind&#8217;. If I close my eyes, I can see cinematic images.&#8221;</p>

<p>The purpose of this blog post (on WordPress and on Archive dot Org (and wherever else this blog post is being reproduced)) is to constrain my social media (i.e. Twitter, Minds, Instagram, and Facebook) to only publishing &#8220;post card quality&#8221; posts. I want it to feel <span style="background:#00ffff;">magical, intriguing, naturalistic, transhumanist, encouraging, educational, and inspirational.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am 70% KARL and 30% KARLINA. I am both KARL and KARLINA at equally limitless proportions at the &#8216;God Head&#8217; level of existence.&#8221;</p>
