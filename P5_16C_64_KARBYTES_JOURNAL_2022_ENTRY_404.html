<p>I decided to stop using the name &#8220;Karlina Ray Beringer&#8221; as the name which I use to refer to myself. The name I prefer to call myself is &#8220;karbytes&#8221;. <span style="background:#ffff00;">The (gender) pronoun I prefer to call myself is &#8220;it&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">&#8220;kabytes&#8221; suggested that I keep using the name &#8220;Karlina Ray Beringer&#8221; as the author name of my intellectual property and what I instruct other people to refer to me as for the sake of minimizing complexity.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;karbytes&#8221; approves of me continuing to self administer testosterone injections (which the state covers the cost (but I do have to pay less than $20 to get syringes and needles from the pharmacy where I have been having my prescriptions for testosterone sent)). It is very likely that I will sprout a beard and hence look unmistakably like a male-bodied human within a five years. I will use &#8220;Karlina Ray Beringer&#8221; for legal (especially as an inmate or as someone being accused of a crime), medical (especially as a patient), and business purposes (especially as a buyer). I will not demand that people (whether those people are strangers, acquaintances, or people I am more intimately familiar with) refer to me using any particular names and pronouns. I do respond well to being called &#8220;Karl&#8221; with male pronouns (i.e. &#8220;he&#8221;, &#8220;him&#8221;, &#8220;his&#8221;).</p>
<p>(I may get referred to as a bearded lady by some).</p>
<p>(I went to Zide Door in Oakland to get a gram of &#8220;ghost penis envy&#8221; ps mushrooms for $13 and consumed the whole gram while walking back to the Fruitvale BART station. I am sitting at my latest hangout spot in Dublin in a relatively rural place not too far from the corporate, residential, and commercial buildings. The sky is mostly clear with large patches of cirrus clouds. I hear the local birds make their vocalizations and respond happily when I hear the crows and turkeys announce their presence).</p>
<p>(I deliberately left my bag (which contained a hand-carved wooden pipe which I was attached to for nostalgic purposes but decided to let go of because I got the most use out of it I feel I really &#8220;needed&#8221;, a butane lighter with a stylized picture of the Statue of Liberty on it, and small crumblings of home-grown weed from my parents who live at two houses in Castro Valley. That bag was originally used to store vegan chocolate sunflower cereal in it called &#8220;Seven Sundays&#8221;) at the Fruitvale BART platform feeling guilty that I was just creating more &#8220;trash&#8221; for other people to clean up and that I was not doing something more &#8220;closure generating&#8221; such as throwing that bag into &#8220;the black hole&#8221; at the East Dublin BART parking garage (which is a fenced off space which I have used as a dumping ground for stuff I wanted to prevent myself from being able to retrieve after discarding). Without that smoking habit, I feel a lot less encumbered and, quite frankly, somewhat less of what I imagine to be &#8220;disabled looking&#8221; (according to animals other than myself)).</p>
<p>(I feel required to feel guilty for apparently being a burden for other people to put up with (and I assume that I am a burden to some humans other than myself to coexist with). At the same time, I feel obliged to stop feeling guilty for violating rules which are neither my own ethical precepts nor what I consider to be logically sound).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">I am presently not willing to kill myself so that some other human can live. (I may even go so far as to kill myself to let someone else live &#8220;last minute&#8221; but I may also end up killing that other person so that I can live instead &#8220;last minute&#8221;; so do not trust me to uphold my promises).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">My desire is to be as independent and as accurate in my understanding of reality as possible and to minimize how much I burden and inflict suffering on creatures other than my individual human-to-cyborg self (which I think is best referred to using the alias &#8220;karbytes&#8221; and the gender pronouns &#8220;it&#8221; and &#8220;its&#8221;).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">As far as I can tell, I am not guilty of violating my own sense of ethics. If I learn that I am violating my own sense of ethics, I ideally would correct my behavior such that I am no longer violating my own sense of ethics (or I may update my sense of ethics to accommodate such behavior).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">(Sometimes &#8220;informally&#8221; I call what I adhere to &#8220;natural law&#8221; (which is basically physics and not what humans necessarily expect nor what humans necessarily intentionally effect). &#8220;Natural law&#8221; permits governments to form, to compete with each other, to evolve, and to die).</span></p>
