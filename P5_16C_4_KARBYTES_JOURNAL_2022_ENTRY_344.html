<p>While hiking through the &#8220;backwoods&#8221; of Lake Chabot Regional Park through the light mist and underneath the moonlit overcast 2AM sky while listening to many owls hooting and also seeing glimpses of the glimmering city lights which rim the bay of the San Francisco Bay Area, I generated (or received) the following ideas (which are possible competing religions which people may find useful to adopt in order to keep them preoccupied with bettering themselves instead of being mired in the myopia of survival and of competing with other beings for physically scarce resources): &#8220;Blank Slate Reincarnation&#8221; and &#8220;Karmic Debt Reincarnation&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Blank Slate Reincarnation&#8221;</strong> is my favorite of the two ideas I proposed. &#8220;Blank Slate Reincarnation&#8221; suggests that, whenever a being dies, that being returns to being at &#8220;base level&#8221; with respect to the most macroscopic multiverse (i.e. the all-encompassing set of all possible universes and all possible multiverses). From the vantage of the &#8220;base level&#8221;, the consciousness which was released from the being which died is free to instantiate into any phenomenon it wants to.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Karmic Debt Reincarnation&#8221;</strong> is my least favorite of the two ideas I proposed because it is not the one selected when <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Occam&#8217;s Razor (*)</a> is applied. &#8220;Karmic Debt Reincarnation&#8221; suggests that, whenever a being dies, that being is only allowed to instantiate as a being of one class to the exclusion of all other classes (and the selected class is a function of that being&#8217;s most recent karmic credit score (and a being&#8217;s karmic credit score can be modeled as an integer which increases by some natural number as a consequence of that being doing something &#8220;good&#8221; and which decreases by some natural number as a consequence of that being doing something &#8220;bad&#8221;)).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>((*) in terms of explaining (using the fewest variables) why a particular sequence of reincarnations for one particular locus of consciousness would occur to the exclusion of all other sequences (asking, &#8220;Is the sequence selection a constrained by karmic debt or is the sequence selection not constrained by karmic debt?&#8221;)) (**)</p>
<p>((**) &#8220;Karmic Debt Reincarnation&#8221; is a subset of the possibilities which &#8220;Blank Sheet Reincarnation&#8221; encompasses. Therefore, if the &#8220;Karmic Debt Reincarnation&#8221; hypothesis is true, a being with the power to instantiate into any form may choose to instantiate into a form which goes through multiple reincarnations according to an arbitrarily specific set of karmic debt rules; thereby invoking an instance of &#8220;Karmic Debt Reincarnation&#8221; for a finite or else an infinite number of lives which are causally linked in exactly one linear sequence.)</p>
